%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Lineups  \cite{buja:2009, wickham:2010} have been established as tools for visual testing
similar to standard statistical inference tests, allowing us to
evaluate the validity of graphical findings in an objective manner. In
simulation studies  \cite{majumder:2011} lineups have been shown as being efficient: the
power of visual tests is comparable to classical tests while being
much less stringent in terms of distributional assumptions made. This
makes lineups versatile, yet powerful, tools in situations where
conditions for regular statistical tests are not or cannot be met. In
this paper we introduce lineups as a tool for evaluating the power of
competing graphical designs. We highlight some of the theoretical
properties and then show results from two studies evaluating competing
designs: both studies are designed to go to the limits of our
perceptual abilities to highlight differences between designs. We use
both accuracy and speed of evaluation as measures of a successful
design. The first study compares the choice of coordinate system:
polar versus Euclidean coordinates. The results show strong support in
favor of Euclidean coordinates in finding fast and accurate answers to
spotting patterns. The second study is aimed at finding shift
differences between distributions. Both studies are motivated by data
problems that we have recently encountered, and explore using
simulated data to evaluate the plot designs under controlled
conditions.  Amazon Turk is used to conduct the studies.  The lineups
provide an effective mechanism for objectively evaluating plot
designs.
